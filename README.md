## Getting Started

**Please DO NOT push your work to a public fork on GitHub!**

Clone **this** repo, please DO NOT make a fork of it.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Paubox/ruby-test.git
```

You'll need to setup your development environment with Ruby. This step is platform dependent, so you'll need to figure it out yourself.

```bash
$ bundle install        # Install dependencies
$ rails db:reset        # Create the local database
```

## Submission guideliness

Be sure that all existing tests pass. The use of Minitest is intentional, please do not change the testing framework.

`rails test`

**Please DO NOT push your work to a public fork on GitHub!**
